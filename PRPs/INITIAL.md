   - Goal optimization over time

### Positioning Strategy

## DOCUMENTATION:

### Key Resources
- **Existing App:** c:\Users\marley\siphio-website\macro-tracker\
- **Design System:** app/globals.css (CSS variables and theme)
- **Components:** components/ (for reference on styling)
- **Tailwind Config:** tailwind.config.ts (extends design system)

### Copy Source
- All copy finalized in this document
- AI feature descriptions based on conversation
- Positioning statement: "Track Your Macros. Let AI Do the Rest."

---

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

- Landing page should be accessible via root route (/) with option to "Enter App"
- OR separate subdomain/path (landing.macro-tracker.com or /landing)
- Consider adding simple analytics (Plausible/Fathom for privacy-first tracking)
- Include meta tags for SEO and social sharing
- Add schema.org markup for SoftwareApplication
- Implement basic A/B testing capability (test headlines, CTA copy)
- Consider adding animated explainer video later
- Plan for blog/content marketing integration later
- No authentication required on landing page (public)

### Email Capture Strategy
**Option 1:** Email capture before trial (build list)
**Option 2:** Direct to trial signup (lower friction)
**Recommendation:** Direct to trial - lower barrier, build list in-app

### Exit Intent
Consider exit-intent popup on desktop:
- Headline: "Wait! Start Your Free Trial"
- Benefit reminder: "AI coach included, no credit card required"
- Simple email form or direct trial CTA
